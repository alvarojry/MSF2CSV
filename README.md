# MSF2CSV
Converts Marvel Strike Force roster files from MHTML into a CSV file with player/character stats

# Issues
1. Wish we didn't need to save users' roster pages individually. Not sure how to resolve this info from the top level Alliance page.
2. Would be great if we could save the URLs to each member (in parsing comments) and use these Player IDs to get updates later.
3. If nothing else, this simplistic approach avoids the complexities of having to deal with webpage authentication.
